Set up Python as an environment variable in your computers settings (for Windows under “system”)

Go to your console

Type cd and the path to the directory where you saved the program and the csv file
(you can copy/paste the path or use tabulator if you know where it is)

If you are in the directory type the application name (parse_file.py) space and then the name of the .csv file you want to convert
(if the .csv file name contains spaces itself add the file name in quotation marks). 

After this a new file named new_tweets_parsed.csv is created in the same folder, while the old file is still there.

If you haven’t set up Python as an environment variable use your terminal to navigate to the folder where Python is installed. 
Then type python.exe <path to the program> <path to the .csv file you want to convert>
(again use quotation marks if the .csv file name contains blanks itself).
